          Chicken
        </h4>
        <p class="dummy">
          The most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative
          ease and low cost of raising chickens—in comparison to mammals such as
          cattle or hogs—chicken meat and chicken eggs have become prevalent in
          numerous cuisines.
          <br><br>
          Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking,
          grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling. Since the latter half of
          the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food.
          Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with
          lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.
          <br><br>
          The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production
          takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In
          developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive
          farming methods while less-developed areas raise chickens using more
          traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to
          be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans
          more than two to one.
          <br><br>
          The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along
          with the grey junglefowl first raised thousands of years ago in the
          northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.
          <br><br>
          Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around
          600 BC.[5] Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the
          Middle Ages. For thousands of years, a number of different kinds of
          chicken have been eaten across most of the Eastern hemisphere,
          including capons, pullets, and hens. It was one of the basic
          ingredients in blancmange, a stew usually consisting of chicken and
          fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.
          <br><br>
          In the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than
          other meats and it was "sought by the rich because [it is] so costly
          as to be an uncommon dish." Chicken consumption in the U.S. increased
          during World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork.[11] In Europe,
          consumption of chicken overtook that of beef and veal in 1996, linked
          to consumer awareness of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow
          disease).
          <br><br>
          Modern varieties of chicken such as the Cornish Cross, are bred
          specifically for meat production, with an emphasis placed on the ratio
          of feed to meat produced by the animal. The most common breeds of
          chicken consumed in the U.S. are Cornish and White Rock.
          <br><br>
          Chickens raised specifically for food are called broilers. In the U.S.,
          broilers are typically butchered at a young age. Modern Cornish Cross
          hybrids, for example, are butchered as early as 8 weeks for fryers and
          12 weeks for roasting birds.
          <br><br>
          Capons (castrated cocks) produce more and fattier meat. For this
          reason, they are considered a delicacy and were particularly popular
          in the Middle Ages.
          <br><br>
          Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated
          fat as most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage.
          <br><br>
          Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated
          roosters excluded). The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. A 100g
          serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams
          of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein for
          the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.
          <br><br>
          In factory farming, chickens are routinely administered with the feed
          additive Roxarsone, an organoarsenic compound which partially
          decomposes into inorganic arsenic compounded in the flesh of chickens,
          and in their feces, which are often used as a fertilizer. The compound
          is used to control stomach pathogens and promote growth. In a 2013
          sample conducted by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health of
          chicken meat from poultry producers that did not prohibit roxarsone,
          70% of the samples in the US had levels which exceeded the safety
          limits as set by the FDA.[23] The FDA has since revised its stance on
          safe limits to inorganic arsenic in animal feed by stating that "any
          new animal drug that contributes to the overall inorganic arsenic
          burden is of potential concern".
          <br><br>
          Information obtained by the Canadian Integrated Program for
          Antimicrobial Resistance (CIPARS) "strongly indicates that
          cephalosporin resistance in humans is moving in lockstep with the use
          of the drug in poultry production". According to the Canadian Medical
          Association Journal, the unapproved antibiotic ceftiofur is routinely
          injected into eggs in Quebec and Ontario to discourage infection of
          hatchlings. Although the data are contested by the industry,
          antibiotic resistance in humans appears to be directly related to the
          antibiotic's use in eggs.
          <br><br>
          A recent study by the Translational Genomics Research Institute showed
          that nearly half (47%) of the meat and poultry in US grocery stores
          was contaminated with S. aureus, with more than half (52%) of those
          bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Furthermore, as per the FDA, more
          than 25% of retail chicken is resistant to 5 or more different
          classes of antibiotic treatment drugs in the United States. An
          estimated 90–100% of conventional chicken contains, at least, one form
          of antibiotic resistance microorganism, while organic chicken has been
          found to have a lower incidence at 84%.

          <br><br>
          In random surveys of chicken products across the United States in 2012,
          the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine found 48% of samples
          to contain fecal matter. On most commercial chicken farms, the
          chickens spend their entire life standing in, lying on, and living in
          their own manure, which is somewhat mixed in with the bedding material
          (e.g., sawdust, wood shavings, chopped straw, etc.).
          <br><br>
          During shipping from the concentrated animal feeding operation farm to
          the abattoir, the chickens are usually placed inside shipping crates
          that usually have slatted floors. Those crates are then piled 5 to 10
          rows high on the transport truck to the abattoir. During shipment, the
          chickens tend to defecate, and that chicken manure tends to sit inside
          the crowded cages, contaminating the feathers and skin of the chickens,
          or rains down upon the chickens and crates on the lower levels of the
          transport truck. By the time the truck gets to the abattoir, most
          chickens have had their skin and feathers contaminated with feces.
          <br><br>
          There is also fecal matter in the intestines. While the slaughter
          process removes the feathers and intestines, only visible fecal matter
          is removed. The high speed automated processes at the abattoir are not
          designed to remove this fecal contamination on the feather and skin.
          The high speed processing equipment tend to spray the contamination
          around to the birds going down the processing line, and the equipment
          on the line itself. At one or more points on most abattoirs, chemical
          sprays and baths (e.g., bleach, acids, peroxides, etc.) are used to
          partially rinse off or kill this bacterial contamination.
          Unfortunately, the fecal contamination, once it has occurred,
          especially in the various membranes between the skin and muscle, is
          impossible to completely remove.
          <br><br>
          With slaughter lines processing up to 140 birds per minute, safety
          inspectors do not have adequate time to properly examine visible fecal
          matter. The USDA is currently allowing some abattoirs to process at
          unlimited line speeds (i.e., in excess of 140 birds per minute),
          further exacerbating the fecal contamination issue.

          Beef
        </h4>
        <p class="dummy">
          The culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus). An uncooked rib
          roast · Wagyu cattle are an example of a breed raised primarily for
          beef.
          <br><br>
          Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak,
          which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings
          are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains
          protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat,
          high consumption is associated with an increased risk of colorectal
          cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when processed. Beef has
          a high environmental impact, being a primary driver of deforestation
          with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product.

          Sushi
        </h4>
        <p class="dummy">
          A Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and
          salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often
          raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely,
          but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari,
          or sumeshi.
          <br><br>
          The inventor of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who
          invented nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most known today, in which
          seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the
          Edo period (1603–1867). It was the fast food of the chōnin class in
          the Edo period.
          <br><br>
          Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it
          can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often
          prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or
          imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often
          served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon
          radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
          <br><br>
          Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese
          cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat.
